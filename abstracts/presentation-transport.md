R for Transport Planning

<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
Since the first release of R on CRAN, in 1997, its use in many fields has grown rapidly.
Lai et al. (2019), for example, suggest that more than 50% of research articles published in Ecology use R in some way.
Much like many ecological datasets, transport data tend to be large, diverse and have spatial *and* temporal attributes.
Unlike Ecology, Transport Planning has been a slow adopter of R, with a much lower percentage of papers using the language.
This raises the question: why?
After exploring this question, in relation to dominant transport planning software products, the talk will sketch of what an open source transport planning 'ecosystem' could look like.
Based on my own experience, of developing the **stplanr** package and teaching practitioners, the talk will discuss the importance of building 'communities of practice', for transport planners making the switch to R.
These observations relate to others promoting R in new environments, and link to the wider question of how to advocate for open source software in wider society.

<!--
Of course, performance is also important.
The talk will conclude by outlining recent developments in the wider area of open source software for transport planning, and its implications for people who currently use, or want to use, R for transport planning research and practice.

<!--JN ideas for the talk
1. create a repo with our setup, including style files, travis setup, etc. and the instructions on how to start
2. explain our setup during the talk (bookdown, GitHub, travis, etc.)
3. explain our working system (e.g. gitter, Skype meeting, use of GitHub issues)
4. show some issues (e.g. having HTML and pdf, too wide code chunks outputs, ...)
5. show how writing a book influence other packages (on a few examples, e.g. including tmap)
