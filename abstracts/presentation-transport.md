R for Transport Planning

<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
Since the release of R 0.49 (the first version available on CRAN) in 1997, its use in many fields has grown rapidly.
Lai et al. (2019), for example, suggest that more than 50% of research article published in Ecology use R in some way.
Transport datasets tend to be large, diverse and have space-time coordinates, much like many ecological datasets.
However, uptake of R for Transport Planning has bee more limited, with a far lower percentage of papers in the field making use of the language, raising the question, why?
After briefly exploring this question, with reference to the history of transport planning practice, and its domination by a few software products, this presentation will sketch an outline of what an open source transport planning 'ecosystem' based on R could look like.
Based on my own experience, of developing the stplanr package and teaching practitioners, the talk will discuss importance of building 'communities of practice', to support early adopters in the field, in addition to performance considerations and how R fits into the wider area of open source software for transport planning.
<!--
Of course, performance is also important.
The talk will conclude by outlining recent developments in the wider area of open source software for transport planning, and its implications for people who currently use, or want to use, R for transport planning research and practice.

<!--JN ideas for the talk
1. create a repo with our setup, including style files, travis setup, etc. and the instructions on how to start
2. explain our setup during the talk (bookdown, GitHub, travis, etc.)
3. explain our working system (e.g. gitter, Skype meeting, use of GitHub issues)
4. show some issues (e.g. having HTML and pdf, too wide code chunks outputs, ...)
5. show how writing a book influence other packages (on a few examples, e.g. including tmap)
