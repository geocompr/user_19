How to win friends and write an open-source book 
<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
In the last few years, we have witnessed a revolution in an R book publishing industry.
Starting from ..., more and more books are published in a new hybrid system.
It allows for "having a cake and eating a cake" at the same time.
An online, open-source version of the book is available freely using a creative commons license, while a printed version of the book is available to buy.
This way (1) the readers can decide if they want to read online or paper version of the book, (2) the book has a high quality due to several rounds of reviews and professional copy editing process.
This revolution would not be possible (?) without several components, including the bookdown package, GitHub (etc.?), .... and many more.
In this talk, we will share our experience with writing the Geocomputation with R book (website).
We will show how to start writing an open-source book, which tools are useful, and how to collaborate on a large project being a continent apart.
We will also mention a few places where improvements are needed (better wording).
Finally, we will give examples of how writing a book could have a positive influence on a larger community.

<!--JN ideas-->
1. create a repo with our setup, including style files, travis setup, etc. and the instructions on how to start
2. explain our setup during the talk (bookdown, GitHub, travis, etc.)
3. explain our working system (e.g. gitter, Skype meeting, use of GitHub issues)
4. show some issues (e.g. having HTML and pdf, ...)
5. show how writing a book influence other packages (on a few examples, e.g. including tmap)
