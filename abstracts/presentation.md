How to win friends and write an open-source book 

<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
Over the last few years, a quiet revolution has been brewing in the R book publishing industry.
Since the publication of early open source books, such as Advanced R (published in 2014), many authors have switched to a hybrid system, in which books are published online *and* in print.
This approach has several advantages, including
(1) people can choose how to read the book, online or in print;
(2) the book retains the process of reviews and professional copy-editing provided by publishers;
(3) the wider community can contribute, leading to many improvements in the code and text.
Several developments have enabled this revolution, including the bookdown package, version control and continuous integration services.
This talk will share our experience of writing the open source book Geocomputation with R (https://geocompr.github.io/).
We will show how to start writing an open-source book, which tools are useful, and how to collaborate on a large project while being a continent apart.
We will also point out a few issues in the process, and how we navigated them.
Overall, we advocate writing an open source book and hope the talk will be useful to others thinking about starting such a project.

<!--JN ideas for the talk
1. create a repo with our setup, including style files, travis setup, etc. and the instructions on how to start
2. explain our setup during the talk (bookdown, GitHub, travis, etc.)
3. explain our working system (e.g. gitter, Skype meeting, use of GitHub issues)
4. show some issues (e.g. having HTML and pdf, too wide code chunks outputs, ...)
5. show how writing a book influence other packages (on a few examples, e.g. including tmap)
