How to win friends and write an open-source book 

<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
In the last few years, we have witnessed a revolution in an R book publishing industry.
Starting from ..., more and more books are published in a new hybrid system.
It allows for a situation when you can have your cake and eat it at the same time.
An online, open-source version of a book is available freely using a creative commons license, while a printed version of the book can be bought from a publisher.
This way (1) the readers can decide if they want to read online or paper version of the book, (2) the book has a high quality due to several rounds of reviews and professional copy editing process.
This revolution would not be easy without several components, including the bookdown package, online version control services (e.g., GitHub), continuous integration services (e.g., Travis CI), and many more.
In this talk, we will share our experience of writing the Geocomputation with R book (https://geocompr.github.io/).
We will show how to start writing an open-source book, which tools are useful, and how to collaborate on a large project while being a continent apart.
We will also point out a few areas where improvements would be welcomed.
Finally, we will give examples of how writing an open-source book can have a positive influence on a larger R community.

<!--JN ideas for the talk
1. create a repo with our setup, including style files, travis setup, etc. and the instructions on how to start
2. explain our setup during the talk (bookdown, GitHub, travis, etc.)
3. explain our working system (e.g. gitter, Skype meeting, use of GitHub issues)
4. show some issues (e.g. having HTML and pdf, ...)
5. show how writing a book influence other packages (on a few examples, e.g. including tmap)
