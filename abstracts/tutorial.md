Geocomputation with R

<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
R has a long history covering many fields of applied statistics.
Spatial data analysis has long been a strength of R, with notable packages in the field including spatial, sgeostat, and splancs, which originated in the S language.
<!--The vast majority of spatial research is geographic, meaning with terrestrial coordinate reference systems (CRSs).-->
The major step was the release of sp, now imported by 500+ packages, the class system of which supports a wide range of CRSs, in 2005.
Another important step was the release of raster, in 2010.
Since then R's spatial capabilities have developed dramatically, with the release of sf (successor of sp), stars (for working with spatiotemporal arrays), and terra (successor of raster) released in 2016, 2018 and 2019, respectively.
In tandem with the development of these new foundations, R's spatial ecosystem is maturing and diversifying in multiple areas including:data access (e.g., rworldmap, rnaturalearth, cshapes); visualization (e.g., rasterVis, leaflet, mapview, ggmap, ggplot2, cartogram, tmap); and modelling (e.g, spatial components in mlr and INLA).

Such diversity is beneficial from the perspectives of resilience and choice, but it can be overwhelming for newcomers to 'R-spatial'.
Motivated by this observation, the goal of this tutorial is provide a friendly, practical guided tour of R's spatial ecosystem.
It will show how to get started with future-proof packages (particularly sf), how to do spatial analysis (including spatial subsetting and aggregation) how to make beautiful maps.
Furthermore, it will provide pointers to further materials, ensuring that participants know where to get help and take confident next steps after the session.
The tutorial will consist of a mixture of presentations, live code demos, and short interactive exercises.
