Geocomputation with R
<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
R has a long history of supporting geographical data and spatial analysis, starting from the spatial, sgeostat, and splancs packages originating in the S language.
These packages have started a neverending creation, development, and expansion of spatial concepts in R.
The major step for R-spatial was the development of the sp package, that was a centerpiece of hundreds of following packages. 
Another important step was the release of the raster package allowing for extremely consistent (?) working with spatial raster datasets.
In the last years, the new wave of R spatial packages seems to appear with the development of sf (successor of sp), and with the creation of terra (successor of raster) and stars (system for working with irregular spatial datasets) on a horizon.
This diversity (and complexity) is visible in almost any branch of spatial workflow, including ... and spatial visualization (packages, such as rasterVis, leaflet, mapview, ggmap, ggplot2, cartogram, tmap, etc.).
The goal of this tutorial is to provide a smooth (?) intro/ a guided tour into an R ecosystem.
<!--This tutorial instead of showing how to get deep with the geospatial analysis in R, will focus on making participants aware of spatial possibilities in R.-->
It will show how to get started with spatial-R, where to get help, how to get involved, and most importantly, how to not get lost in it.
The tutorial will consist of a mixture of presentations, live code demos, and short interactive exercises.
