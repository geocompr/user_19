Geocomputation with R

<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
Spatial data analysis has long been one of R's strengths, with a history dating back to the 1990s and milestones including the release of sp in 2005 and raster in 2010.
Since then, R's spatial capabilities have continued to evolve, notably with the release of sf, which integrates spatial vector data with the tidyverse, in 2016
In tandem such developments, R's spatial ecosystem is maturing and diversifying in multiple areas including data access (e.g., rworldmap, rnaturalearth, cshapes); visualization (e.g., rasterVis, leaflet, mapview, ggmap, ggplot2, cartogram, tmap); and modeling (e.g, spatial components in mlr and INLA).

Such diversity has benefits, but can be overwhelming.
The goal of this tutorial is to provide a practical overview of R's spatial ecosystem; the target audience is R users who are new to geographic data.
The focus on *getting started*, with demonstrations of key packages (particularly sf), spatial analysis (including spatial subsetting and aggregation), making maps.
Pointers to further materials will ensure that participants know where to get help and how to take confident next steps after the session.
