Geocomputation with R
<!--an abstract 1200 characters max-->
R has a long history of supporting spatial data analysis, starting from the spatial, sgeostat, and splancs packages originating in the S language.
These packages have started a neverending creation, development, and expansion of spatial ideas in R.
The major step for R spatial was a development of the sp package, which has been a centerpiece of hundreds of packages. 
Another important step was a release of the raster package facilitating work with spatial raster datasets.
In the last years, a new wave of the R spatial packages seems to appear with a creation of sf (successor of sp), and with a development of terra (successor of raster) and stars (system for working with irregular spatial datasets) on a horizon.
This diversity (and complexity) is visible in almost any group of R spatial packages, including spatial data access (e.g., rworldmap, rnaturalearth, cshapes) and spatial visualization (e.g., rasterVis, leaflet, mapview, ggmap, ggplot2, cartogram, tmap).
The goal of this tutorial is to give participants a friendly guided tour into an R spatial ecosystem.
<!--This tutorial instead of showing how to get deep with the geospatial analysis in R, will focus on making participants aware of spatial possibilities in R.-->
It will show how to get started with spatial-R, where to get help, how to get involved, and most importantly, how to not get lost in it.
The tutorial will consist of a mixture of presentations, live code demos, and short interactive exercises.
