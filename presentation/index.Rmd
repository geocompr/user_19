# the Geocomputation with R book

<!-- 1. intro to the book -->
<!-- 2. intro to the concepts of open source books: -->
<!-- Over the last few years, a quiet revolution has been brewing in the R book publishing industry. -->
<!-- Since the publication of early open source books, such as Advanced R (published in 2014), many authors have switched to a hybrid system, in which books are published online *and* in print. -->
<!-- This approach has several advantages, including -->
<!-- (1) people can choose how to read the book, online or in print, and make an informed decision before buying it; -->
<!-- (2) the book retains the process of reviews and professional copy-editing provided by publishers; -->
<!-- (3) the wider community can contribute, leading to many improvements in the code and text. -->

# Why?

<!-- 5. show how writing a book influence other packages (on a few examples, e.g. including tmap) -->

# How to start

<!-- Several developments have enabled this revolution, including the bookdown package, online version control services (e.g., GitHub), continuous integration services (e.g., Travis CI), and many more. -->
<!-- 2. explain our setup during the talk (bookdown, GitHub, travis, etc.) -->
<!-- 3. explain our working system (e.g. gitter, Skype meeting, use of GitHub issues) -->

<!-- We will show how to start writing an open-source book, which tools are useful, and how to collaborate on a large project while being a continent apart. -->
